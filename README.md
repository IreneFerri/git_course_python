# Git Course Assignment

We want to interact in teams. 

- You can clone this repository.
- In a new branch:
    - Somebody works on goodby.py
- In another branch:
    - Somebody works on hello.py to ask for the name of the user.
- Try to merge the first one in main branch.
- Try to merge the second one in main branch.

(better if the merge is done by the other person, who can review the code before merging)


To create a new file that handles the user's name and can be used by both goodbye.py and hello.py, what steps would you take?
